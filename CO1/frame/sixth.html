        <h1>Paris</h1>
        <p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion,
            gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine.
            Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is
            known for its cafe
            culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©.</p>
